give me an explanation of command/query in object oriented programming, how this obeys the law of demeter, and why getters/setters are evil

Command/query separation (CQS) is a principle in object-oriented programming that states that methods should either be commands (perform an action) or queries (return a value), but not both. This principle helps to keep code clear, understandable, and maintainable.

Here's how it relates to the Law of Demeter:

## Commands: 
Methods that perform actions or modify the state of an object. They should not return any value other than what is necessary for signaling success or failure of the operation. Commands typically change the internal state of an object and don't return any information about that state.

## Queries: 
Methods that return information about the state of an object without modifying it. Queries should not have side effects. They simply return information about the object's state.

By adhering to the CQS principle, you ensure that methods are clear in their intent, making code easier to understand, reason about, and maintain. This also helps with adhering to the Law of Demeter, which states that an object should only interact with its immediate neighbors.

## Now, regarding getters and setters:

Getters and setters are methods used to retrieve and modify the internal state of an object, respectively. They violate the CQS principle because they act as both queries (returning information about the object's state) and commands (modifying the object's state). This can lead to code that is harder to understand and maintain, as it blurs the distinction between querying and modifying behavior.

Additionally, getters and setters can also violate the Law of Demeter when used excessively. For example, if an object A calls a getter on another object B to retrieve some information, then calls a setter on object B to modify its state, it is effectively reaching too deep into the internal structure of object B. This tight coupling makes the code more brittle and harder to maintain.

Instead of using getters and setters, it's often better to define methods that encapsulate the behavior you want to expose, following the CQS principle. This promotes better encapsulation, reduces coupling between objects, and leads to more maintainable code.
